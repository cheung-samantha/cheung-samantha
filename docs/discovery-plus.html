				<h4 class="special">Background</h4>
				<h4>Product</h4>
				<p>discovery+ was Discovery Inc's direct to consumer digital streaming service, giving users instant access to 2,500+ current and classic shows from lifestyle TV brands (HGTV, Food Network, and TLC), as well as nature and adventure channels (Animal Planet, Discovery Channel, and ID). Since then, discovery+ has merged with HBO Max into Max as part of Discovery Inc's merger with Warner Bros.</p>

				<h4>Role</h4>
				<p>UX Design Intern, summer 2021</p>
				<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
				<p>By rethinking how we keep users aware of new available content, we're providing a more personalized and simplified experience for our users that will also positively impact customer satisfaction and conversion rates for consuming content.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row" style="padding: 24px">
			<div class="left-col">
				<h4 class="special">Research</h4>
				<h4>How do we know this is a real problem?</h4>
				<p>1. Finding and navigating to new episodes has been a source of frustration among users (30-35 customer feedback tickets submitted monthly + multiple Reddit threads devoted to this issue)</p>
				<p>2. In app store reviews, customers suggest the use of visual tags / badges on show thumbnails to indicate the availability of new content.</p>
				<p>3. Respondents from a prior research study indicated that when they did not watch a show upon opening the app, it was due to an inability to find newly released content.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="right-col">
				<h4 class="hidden"> Header</h4>				
				<p>There was not a process on discovery+ by which users could determine, at a glance, whether a given show had recently added a new epsiode. In addition, users have expressed difficulty with navigating to the newest episode of a show.</p>

			<div class="left-col">
				<h4 class="special">Process</h4>
				<h4>Ideation Session</h4>
				<p>After creating "How might we" statements based on known user problems from customer feedback tickets and features as seen through competitive analysis, I organized and led an ideation session with UX design and research partners. We used the silent circuit ideation and dot voting methods.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="right-col">
				<h4 class="hidden">Header</h4>
				<h4>Hypotheses + Prioritization</h4>
				<p>I used the generated ideas to create hypothesis statements and worked with my mentor to prioritize them by organizing them into a matrix measuring risk and perceived user value.</p>
				<p>Our goal was to handoff low risk and high perceived user value hypotheses / design recommendations to the product design and research teams for mockups and further research.</p>

				<h4 class="special">Project Wrap Up</h4>
				<h4>Handoff</h4>
				<p>The next steps were to hand off design recommendations / opportunities to the product design team. They'll create mockups and any prototypes needed for user testing. As a UX design intern, I would then work with the UX research intern to create a user testing plan using the assets from the product design team.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="right-col">
				<h4 class="hidden">header</h4>
				<h4>Reflection</h4>
				<p>It's our job as UX designers to always advocate for the user and to help Product see initiatives from the user's point of view instead of from strictly the business's.</p>
				<p>I was lucky enough to present to product, research, and design teams and one of their immediate suggestions was adding badging to series thumbnails. Although this was a good idea, it was important for me to think about addressing the core user problem first instead of coming up with solutions right away.</p>
